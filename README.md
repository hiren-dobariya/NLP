Models do not directly understand human language. There are techniques that convert human language into meaningful vectors. This process, where a model takes human language as input and converts it into vectors, is called Natural Language Processing (NLP).
NLP techniques (like tokenization, embeddings, word2vec, transformers, etc.) convert human language into numerical representations (vectors).
These vectors capture meaning and context so the model can process them.
